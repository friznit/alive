[B][U]What is Insurgency | ALiVE[/U][/B]
Insurgency | ALiVE is a throwback to the old Arma 2 Insurgency by Fireball+Pogoman. Players must search houses or kill enemy units to find randomly generated INTEL items which mark enemy cache locations. 
Destroy X amount of cache locations to win!

[B][U]So many different version of Insurgency why another?[/U][/B]
This mission was actually originally created around DEC-2013/JAN-2014 and was built as a template and released on the alivemod.com website.
After many months of leaving the project to collect dust I saw a few version of it floating around the forums playable but not pretty.
I have since then decided to finish the framework and release it back into the community for others to alter and use for their own personal groups.

[B][U]So it was created with a purpose?[/U][/B]
Yes!!!! Back in 2013-2014 I really wanted to show the power of ALiVE as it was just getting its first release. ALiVE is so much more than just an AI Commander as some would say.
We have a very extensive functions library for mission creators to hook into. This mission is a great example of the things that can be done using ALiVE!

[B][U]How To Play.[/U][/B]
Search and clear the indicated red grids. (When Enabled VIA CQB module) When a grid is cleared it will turn green. 
Be sure to search the houses for randomly generated INTEL items.
Picking up INTEL items will create a marker in the general area of a cache location.
Find and destroy the cache.
