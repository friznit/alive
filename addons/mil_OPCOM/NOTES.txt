*Model - no visual just reference data*
- list of objectives and priorities
- enemy force composition as profiles

*Controller - *
- None

*View - purely visual*
- None

---Not OPCOM---
And you can apply rules so they move from one to the other depending on situation and current force strength
So for example you could hypothetically have a Comd starting as Offensive, captures several objectives but loses a lot of troops, goes defensive arounnd his HQ location
get's a resupply, goes offensive again

Depending on the enemy's STANCE (ie safe, aware, etc) - I'd like for spawned AI to walk around the base casually if they have no clue we are near. Its a long way down the road, but it would be awesome seeing them go into danger mode and all regroup and jump in vehicles, etc.

- mission editor defines an AO and specifies then enemy is invading from a position (should be performed by Logistics)

Basics of OPCOM Design

This is version 1 of this module. Its specifically about appropriate placement of enemy units.

OPCOM Definition
Initial placement of Enemy based on clustered objectives within the AO. In a persisted situation, the stance, etc would change during gameplay and be persisted as well, restoring if the mission is restarted ie params within editor module ignored.

Parameters
A single editor module is placed for OPCOM, with the following parameters:
- Enemy Size: 1/2/3 Platoon, 1/2/3 Company, Battallion or auto based on objectives
- Initial Enemy Stance: SAFE, AWARE, DANGER - this chooses if the enemy are well defended and on active patrols. As enemy aggravates, reinforcements can come from outside the map
- Available Unit Types: Infantry, Motorised, Mechanised, Armour, Anti-air, Mortars, Artillery, Special Forces?, Sniper Teams?, Airborne
- AO Marker(s?)
- Blacklist Markers: Marker names that are used to identify blacklisted areas
- Posture (Defence/Offence/Occupying/Insurgency)
- Skill level (Green, Regular, Veteran)
- Factions

Once the size, is chosen, locations are looked for or created from the top down - for example, Tactical Command will look for Military Offices, otherwise annex a civilian office or create a tent camp for them. Camps for example, are created once, and PDB stores them as objects rather than recreating them every restart.

All randomisation is based on the randomSeed value found in the misson.sqm (currently not possible) - check Destroy City on how to use seeds for randomisation. This means that the mission looks the same on every restart until the seed is changed.

Use Cases:
- mission editor defines an AO, size is calculated automatically, and the enemy is already present but relaxed
- drop OPCOM module and select size of unit - Bn, Coy, Pl

Assume location of module on the map is the start point or HQ point as the highest priority

Example: So OPCOM needs to generate a Platoon

The Mission Editor has dropped the OPCOM module in the editor and selected ratios like so:
Infantry = 4
Support = 2
SpecOps = 1
Motorised = 2
Mechanised = 1
Armour = 0
Air = 1

So for a platoon it decides it needs 3 sections/squads - the ratios determine it might get 3 from Infantry (2 x regular sqd and Weapons sqd)
OR
It chooses 2 from Infantry (1 x Reg sqd and 1 x AT team) and 1 from Support (1 x Mortars)

I think later in v1, I will included units either static (defending & foot patrols) or mobile (larger motor/mech patrols, reinforcements, attacking, recon) but for now it will be simply enemy placement and defense of placement.

Company Types:
- Rifle Company
- Artillery Battery
- Headquarters company
- Heavy weapons/Combat Support Company administratively contains the specialized infantry platoons such as Reconnaissance Platoon, Pioneer Platoon, Headquarters and Signals Platoon, Anti-Armour Platoon, and Mortar Platoon
- Support/Administration Support Company contains the support tradesmen which a battalion requires, such as cooks, vehicle technicians, supply, medics, etc.
- Motorised Rifle Company mounted in BTR/BMP
	- BTR rifle company consisted of a company headquarters, three motorised rifle platoons and a machine gun/antitank platoon with two PK machine guns and two AT-7 Saxhorn launchers for a total of 110 personnel and 12 BTRs
	- BMP rifle company had the same number of personnel and carriers and also consisted of a company headquarters and three motorised rifle platoons but instead included a machine gun platoon with six RPK-74s
- Tank companies at 10 tanks, with three tanks in each platoon plus HQ tank
- Headquarters and Service Company
	- Service Platoon, consisting of S-4, Motor Transportation, Food Service, armorers, and Supply.
	- Scout Sniper Platoon.
	- Medical Platoon
- Airborne - Airborne forces are generally composed of infantry and light, non-armored vehicles and guns
	- Paratroopers - Infantry soldier landed by parachute from aircraft
	- Air assault troops or airmobile infantry—transported to the battle by helicopter or by aircraft.

Tupolov:
OPCOM accepts input from mission maker. Mission maker is essentially 2 UP from player. 2 UP is the commander that says, here's the situation, I want you to defend/attack/occupy/counter insurgency/raid/invade X location. I expect a BN/coy/platoon with inf/mech/armour/air assets.
OPCOM then deploys the EN bn/coy/platoon of assets based on area focus and priority of clusters.
OPCOM is 1 UP and manages EN forces deployed to either attack/defend/disrupt/protect/repulse BLUFOR. Opcom can also act as 1up for BLUFOR and allocate tasks.
The location could be the whole of Stratis, but it also could be the southern coast etc
Based on area, priority of cluster and enemy size you split the 'template' assets across the priority clusters
So might get a whole bn defending the coast and the key clusters around there.
----------------------------------------
Friznit:
Process (and to clear up the language a bit):
1. Mission Maker defines strategic situation with OPCOM (Invasion, Occupation, Insurgency) -> OPCOM outputs a list of locations prioritised by relative strategic importance (these are called *Objectives*)
2.  Mission Maker defines force composition available for OPCOM Commander(s) and its *Mission*
a. Size (Bn, Coy Pl)
b. Type (Armoured, Mech, Light, Airborne, Marine)
c.  Mission (Attack, Defend, Occupy, Raid, Terrorize etc)
3.  OPCOM defines *Tasks* for forces under command (3Pl attack Objective A; 1Coy defence Objective C etc)
4.  OPCOM reacts to the changing situation and defines new tasks on the fly (Engr Troop repair Chopper A; Logistics Group move to Grid XXX; Tank Troop replen at Objective C)



Defending (Dug-in)
Occupation (Patrolling)
Insurgency (Civilian infrastructure)
