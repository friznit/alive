- Enabled debug messages

_minWeatherChangeTimeMin - Minimum time in minutes for the weather to change. Must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to _maxWeatherChangeTimeMin. When weather changes, it is fog OR overcast that changes, not both at the same time. (Suggested value: 10).
_maxWeatherChangeTimeMin - Maximum time in minutes for the weather to change. Must be greater than or equal to _minWeatherChangeTimeMin. (Suggested value: 20).
_minTimeBetweenWeatherChangesMin - Minimum time in minutes that weather stays constant between weather changes. Must be less than or equal to 0 and greater than or equal to _minWeatherChangeTimeMin. (Suggested value: 5).
_maxTimeBetweenWeatherChangesMin -  Maximum time in minutes that weather stays unchanged between weather changes. Must be greater than or equal to _minWeatherChangeTimeMin. (Suggested value: 10).
_minimumFog - Fog intensity never falls below this value. Must be between 0 and 1 and less than or equal to _maximumFog (0 = no fog, 1 = pea soup). (Suggested value: 0).
_maximumFog - Fog intensity never exceeds this value. Must be between 0 and 1 and greater than or equal to _minimumFog (0 = no fog, 1 = pea soup). (Suggested value: 0.1).
_minimumOvercast - Overcast intensity never falls below this value. Must be between 0 and 1 and less than or equal to _maximumOvercast (0 = no overcast, 1 = maximum overcast). (Suggested value: 0).
_maximumOvercast - Overcast intensity never exceeds this value. Must be between 0 and 1 and greater than or equal to _minimumOvercast (0 = no overcast, 1 = maximum overcast). (Suggested value: 1).
_minimumRain - When raining, rain intensity never falls below this value. Must be between 0 and 1 and less than or equal to _maximumRain (0 = no rain, 1 = maximum rain intensity). (Suggested value: 0);
_maximumRain - When raining, rain intensity never exceeds this value. Must be between 0 and 1 and greater than or equal to _minimumRain (0 = no rain, 1 = maximum rain intensity). (Suggested value: 0.8);
_minimumWind - Wind vector strength never falls below this value. Must be greater or equal to 0 and less than or equal to _maximumWind. (Suggested value: 0).
_maximumWind -  Wind vector strength never exceeds this value. Must be greater or equal to 0 and greater than or equal to _minimumWind. (Suggested value: 1).
_windChangeProbability - Probability in percent for wind to change when weather changes. If set to 0 then wind will never change. If set to 100 then rain will change every time the weather (fog or overcast) start to change. (Suggested value: 25).
_rainIntervalRainProbability - A "rain interval" is defined as "a time interval during which it may rain in any intensity (or it may not rain at all)". When overcast goes above 0.75, a chain of rain intervals (defined below) is started. It cycles on until overcast falls below 0.75. At overcast below 0.75 rain intervals never execute (thus it cannot rain). Probability in percent (0-100) for rain to start at every rain interval. Set this to 0 if you don't want rain at all. Set this to 100 if you want it to rain constantly when overcast is greater than 0.75. In short: if you think that it generally rains to often then lower this value and vice versa. (Suggested value: 50).
_LightningProbability - If it rains and is over 0.75 set this to the probability it will lightning too.
_minRainIntervalTimeMin - Minimum time in minutes for rain intervals. Must be greater or equal to 0 and less than or equal to _maxRainIntervalTimeMin. (Suggested value: 0).
_forceRainToStopAfterOneRainInterval - If set to true, then the rain is forced to stop after one rain interval during which it has rained (use this for example if you only want small occational cloudbursts ). If set to false, then the rain may stop, but it may also just change intensity for an immedeate new rain interval. (Suggested value: false).
