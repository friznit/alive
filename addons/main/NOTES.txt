- in fnc_baseclass there would be sense in adapting it in the following ways, to be able to create a baseclass for another module, not only the main baseclass. All created sub-Instances of any module could be traced in the main superclass:
----- create center only if there isnt a center existing already.
----- provide an operation "createInstance".
----- provide the function to pass via _args like.
----- example: _newInstanceLogic = [_logic,"createInstance",ALiVE_fnc_CQB] call ALiVE_fnc_baseclass.
----- operation "destroy" in fnc_baseclass does not need setdamage 1, only deletevehicle _logic.
----- Also setting superclass and class to nil isnt implemented.
----- automated tests: i question the sense of only testing the main classes like fnc_baseclass. What about all the common functions added? Would they all need a seperate testcase? Is this efficient?

----- this is a good example of what i really dont like: a full page of documantation for a ONE-LINER...
----- the function is NOT named after what it is doing. This is the function for a VOTED admin, for a real server-admin it would need to be checked for "#shutdown" as this command isnt available for voted admins.

- seperating functions (subfolders wont work)
----- during integration of CQB i found that nearly every function could be used by another module. CQB NG f.e. example used MSO_STRATEGIC functions (another module) and created cross dependencies. This would mean that nearly every function atm. to be a common function - but this is not the way its intended, is it? I still did not understand what was meant with seperate pbos for functions.

- usage of CBA
----- i know i bash on it like a little drummer boy. To adress most users with our framework we EITHER need to deploy CBA WITH our Mod Completely OR inherit all the functions and Macros OR FORGET ABOUT CBA (my recommendation). Dont get me wrong, i like CBA but i dont want to loose ONE SINGLE PLAYER thru it. Guess why Dynaimc War Sandox is on rank 4 of armas most played mishs.
