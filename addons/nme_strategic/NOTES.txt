---Not SEP---
And you can apply rules so they move from one to the other depending on situation and current force strength
So for example you could hypothetically have a Comd starting as Offensive, captures several objectives but loses a lot of troops, goes defensive arounnd his HQ location
get's a resupply, goes offensive again

Depending on the enemy's STANCE (ie safe, aware, etc) - I'd like for spawned AI to walk around the base casually if they have no clue we are near. Its a long way down the road, but it would be awesome seeing them go into danger mode and all regroup and jump in vehicles, etc.

- mission editor defines an AO and specifies then enemy is invading from a position (should be performed by Logistics)

Basics of SEP Design

This is version 1 of this module. Its specifically about appropriate placement of enemy units.

SEP Definition
Initial placement of Enemy based on clustered objectives within the AO. In a persisted situation, the stance, etc would change during gameplay and be persisted as well, restoring if the mission is restarted ie params within editor module ignored.

Parameters
A single editor module is placed for SEP, with the following parameters:
- Enemy Size: 1/2/3 Platoon, 1/2/3 Company, Battallion or auto based on objectives
- Initial Enemy Stance: SAFE, AWARE, DANGER - this chooses if the enemy are well defended and on active patrols. As enemy aggravates, reinforcements can come from outside the map
- Available Unit Types: Infantry, Motorised, Mechanised, Armour, Anti-air, Mortars, Artillery, Special Forces?, Sniper Teams?, Airborne
- AO Marker(s?)
- Blacklist Markers: Marker names that are used to identify blacklisted areas
- Posture (Defence/Offence/Occupying/Insurgency)
- Skill level (Green, Regular, Veteran)
- Factions

Once the size, is chosen, locations are looked for or created from the top down - for example, Tactical Command will look for Military Offices, otherwise annex a civilian office or create a tent camp for them. Camps for example, are created once, and PDB stores them as objects rather than recreating them every restart.

All randomisation is based on the randomSeed value found in the misson.sqm (currently not possible) - check Destroy City on how to use seeds for randomisation. This means that the mission looks the same on every restart until the seed is changed.

Use Cases:
- mission editor defines an AO, size is calculated automatically, and the enemy is already present but relaxed
- drop SEP module and select size of unit - Bn, Coy, Pl

Assume location of module on the map is the start point or HQ point as the highest priority

Posture
Defence - Comd 'digs in in vicinity of HQ', sets up MG posts, occupies buildings, sends out local patrols (focussed on a single high value objective)
Offence - Comd looks for objectives in prio order, sends out recces & fighting patrols, advancing from one to the other
Occupying - Comd spreads forces around objectives within AO, occupies buildings and carries out patrols, roadblocks, logistics etc (spread out over the AO)
Insurgency - Comd sends small groups out to plant IEDs, VBIED, suicide bummers, weapons caches etc

Example: So SEP needs to generate a Platoon

The Mission Editor has dropped the SEP module in the editor and selected ratios like so:
Infantry = 4
Support = 2
SpecOps = 1
Motorised = 2
Mechanised = 1
Armour = 0
Air = 1

So for a platoon it decides it needs 3 sections/squads - the ratios determine it might get 3 from Infantry (2 x regular sqd and Weapons sqd)
OR
It chooses 2 from Infantry (1 x Reg sqd and 1 x AT team) and 1 from Support (1 x Mortars)

I think later in v1, I will included units either static (defending & foot patrols) or mobile (larger motor/mech patrols, reinforcements, attacking, recon) but for now it will be simply enemy placement and defense of placement.
