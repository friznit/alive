TODO
- storing a customized rifle in a backpack, doesn't persist custom items etc
- ammo state not saved correctly
- inventory state isn't sync'd between client and server for JIP (use put/take EH)
- Look at getting data from client rather than server (not reliable)
- 2nd manual save causes error
- code review
