TODO
- vest uniform changes don't get synced to server for some reason for JIP clients... BIS issue, need to workaround it. server does not seem to respect uniform, vest loads? - JIP disconnect does not store items from vest or uniform.
- 2nd manual save causes error
- Player menu - auto save set interval gui
- load players to db
