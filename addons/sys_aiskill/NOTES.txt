Wolffy.au:
Firstly, does this mean that every unit of the faction is identically set? If 
so, my preference is to keep the BI model, that different ranks get different
skill levels, which means team leaders are more skilled and more important to
kill during game play.

I would suggest change the design of this module, but it might be over-engineering.

Firstly, as a component, I would expect that the spawn process can be stopped
and started as required. Personally, I would create an "active"(bool)
operation to stop and start process. I would check for a getVariable at the end
of every waitUnil, which can be set remote by a call to active(false).
