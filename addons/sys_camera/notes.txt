Camera system

Headline: Automated in game camera that catches key action events as they happen

Description: Similar to spectator mode, this module provides an automated camera that follows key events in game. A player can opt for their client to act as the "camera". This is useful for groups or clans to record operations for playback later or for streaming to services such as twitch.tv. The camera utilizes typical "hollywood" shots and shot lengths to provide an action/documentary feel. If ACRE is used, the camera system will also attempt to capture key conversations between group leaders.

Types of Shots / Trigger:
- Close up shot - for conversations/radio order, in building
- Satellite shot - random/filler shot
- aerial shot - landing, enter location, initial contact
- Over the shoulder - infantry shooting
- Reverse shot - enemy over the shoulder shot(target) - enemy being shot at by BLUFOR
- Vehicle wheel shot - vehicle movement
- Aircraft wing shot (OTS aircraft) - missile lock, target lock, fired EH
- Weapon shot - fired eh
- Pilot View - target lock
- Missile shot - missile fired
- Bullet cam? - missile/fired eh
- Side Tracking shot - group movement
- Cameraman shot - blufor near enemy, movement - increase head bob
- Ground tracking shot - movement, like cameraman but tracks something
- Front tracking shot - group movement
- 2 person shot - on heal
- Behind tracking shot - fired eh focus on shooter tracking to target
- Optics view - fired eh
- medium shot - explosion, killed, getin, getout
- establishing shot - entering location

In-game: 

Admins can

- Enable/Disable Camera System
- Select player/client that can act as camera

Players can

- Turn on camera
- Turn off camera

Mechanism Concept:

Server tracks server side events and sends camera command (event information) to camera client
All clients track client side events and send camera command to camera client
Camera client initializes camera and runs through "non event" shots until a new command is received, new command is evaluated based on priority and put in stack of shots
If shot expires prior to reaching top of stack of commands, then its deleted
Current running shot has a shot length (Min 2 seconds and max 7 seconds) after 2 seconds the shot can be interrupted by a priority shot
After shot completion next shot in stack takes over
Stack is filled with "non-event" shots if no commands received
Camera runs until client selects stop or Admin stops camera
No player input while camera is running other than action menu to stop camera
Admin can kill Camera at anytime

Mechanism Implementation:

Camera Module logic object placed in editor
On init module sets params and waits for Camera Client to identify itself
EH setup via config on appropriate classes (vehicles)
EH only executes if Camera System in ON
EH will send event information to Camera Client (client id must be set on object)
Admin/player set client as Camera 
Logic is updated with client info and marked as "ON"
Any EH that fires, command/info is sent to Camera Client using either CBA Events or ALIVE BUS
Camera client processes info and places info into a "stack" based on priority (CBA HASH?)
Camera client instantiates a camera based on top of stack request
Admin or player stops Camera Client, logic is set to "OFF"
