[U][B]ALiVE WarRoom Updates[/B][/U]

As we continue to develop features for the War Room, we are pleased to advise a couple of great new additions to the Operations Maps.
We have added an event timeline, where you can step through each event, as it happened at a given time within your mission.
Using the timeline you can even play back the whole operation, seeing who killed what, where and when.

In addition to the event timeline, we have also added your kill information.
Clicking on a "KILL" Event will now show where the Player\AI was when they got the kill, 
where the killed Player\AI was when they were killed and will be indicated by an animated kill line.

At present we have only created the in game maps in the War Room for some of the biggest used AO's, we will be adding them all in due course.
