Please refer to the [URL="http://www.alivemod.com/wiki"]ALiVE Wiki[/URL].  It’s not pretty but all the info you need should be there.  If anything is missing or unclear, please let us know by submitting a ticket on our Development Tracker and we’ll look to fix it.

[B][U]IMPORTANT NOTICES: [/U][/B]Be aware that ALiVE Persistence is still in ALPHA and subject to change.  We may also need to clear database data before major updates but we will let you know well in advance if this happens. Be aware you will not be able to load/save data from pre 0.6.8 missions with the latest plugin. Please create new missions (new name) for 0.6.8 persistence.

Please check your CQB module and reset your preferred options! Be aware you can use several instances for civilian and or strategic locations, TAORs, factions, etc.!

Disclaimer[/U][/B]
We have done our best to ensure backward compatibility for your missions. However, in case you get a new error with an existing mission, please delete and replace the offending module in the editor and you should be good to go again.  As usual, please post any issues or feature requests on our tracker.

Work In Progress[/U][/B]
Our next major design milestone is Logistics.  This includes a simple “Lift & Shift Objects” module and a Player “Replen Demand” dialogue.  We will do our best to ensure compatibility with other popular mods that provide similar functionality.

The main focus is on an AI Battlefield Logistics system to support OPCOM.  This models realistic military supply lines including strategic lift and convoys.
