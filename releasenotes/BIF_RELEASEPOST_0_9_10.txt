[SIZE=4]The next generation dynamic persistent mission addon for ArmA3
Release 0.9.10[/SIZE][/B][/CENTER]

[B][U]Major new features for ALiVE in this release: Headless Client, Linux Persistence, Command & Control Tablet, Group Manager[/U][/B]
We are very excited to release a completely rewritten plugin that supports both Windows and Linux dedicated servers.  Massive thanks to Secure for his code magic and dedication over the last few months making Linux persistence a reality. Follow the instructions on War Room to setup your server. The latest plugin is REQUIRED for all ALiVE 0.9.10 servers, both Windows and Linux.  The old plugins will no longer work.

Meanwhile, Highhead solved one of our biggest challenges of how to spawn all ALiVE Virtual AI onto Headless Client.  The option to use Headless Client for all AI Placement modules represents a huge performance boost for those who enjoy full scale dynamic campaigns with thousands of AI and lots of players in different parts of the map.  The option to use Headless Client can be found in the ALiVE (Required) module.

In addition, Tupolov has been working to improve the Server Performance Monitoring suite, which now has the option to autorun on any mission even without an ALiVE module placed.  This requires an optional pbo to be run on the server and of course you need to login to War Room and set up your server details there to see the stats.  Thanks to Dwarden for the feedback!

Some people have already seen SpyderBlack's fantastic Command & Control tablet, which enables players to create map overlays of operational activity, tactical intelligence and even take over control of the battle from the AI Commander.  We loved it so much that we have fully integrated it into ALiVE and will continue to work with Spyder to develop it further.  Alongside this, ArJay has been hard at work developing a Group Manager (for both Player and AI groups), which has long been a popular request by the community.

Tupolov has made some enhancements to the IED module, allowing you to use custom assets for urban and roadside IEDs as well as clutter to help disguise them. He has also improved the Suicide Bomber code to make things a little more..."fun". 

We've also added ambient Sea Patrols to our Military Objectives (Civilian) module. OPFOR and BLUFOR will now execute both surface and subsurface patrols near strategic maritime locations. You will need to configure custom "Naval" groups to use maritime groups with mods that don't have them defined already.  See the wiki for details of custom mappings.

Finally, you will find another update to the ALiVE Menu system. We've tidied it up and now provide 4 sub menus - Player Options, Admin Actions, Commander Actions and Module Settings. Player Options allow you to configure your player experience, while Admin Actions give you some tools to help mission creation/management. Module Settings is new and we will building on this, allowing you to change module settings on the fly (where appropriate), such as the IED module for example. Commander Actions is available if you place the C2ISTAR module and gives you access to lots of tools such as Combat Support, Resupply, Intel, Group Manager and Task Manager.

The rest of the team has been busy with fixes and enhancements - full change log below!

[CENTER]Please note that as with all updates, if you have an issue loading a mission made with a previous version of ALiVE, delete and replace the modules in that mission.

[B][U]Work In Progress?[/U][/B]
This is essentially our 1.0 Release Candidate but there are a few things we'd like to fix still.  Headless Client introduces several locality challenges with commands and War Room stats that we'd like to iron out.  There is also an annoying button rsc error in arma3 rpt since the last patch that we need to squash.  Elsewhere we're beginning to look at greater ACE3 support and integration.

[B][U]Disclaimer[/U][/B]
ALiVE is still in BETA and subject to change.  We may need to clear persistent database data from the War Room before major updates but we will try to let you know well in advance if this happens.  We have done our best to ensure backward compatibility for your missions. However, in case you get a new error with an existing mission, please delete and replace the offending module in the editor and you should be good to go again.  As usual, please post any issues or feature requests on our tracker.
