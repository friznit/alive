[b]IMINT[/b]
Those of you who watched the recent BIS livestream with 21st Rangers would have heard Friznit talking about the importance of Intel to battlefield commanders.  We've wanted to review the way Operational Intelligence is gathered and presented to Players in ALiVE in order to provide a more realistic and comprehensive set of tools.  At the tactical level, Intelligence is typically collected from sources such as EM signals, images and humans.  ALiVE already simulates HUMINT with the ability to talk to civilians and collect data on possible hostile activity.  SpyderBlack has now added a new IMINT capability to Player Commanders.  Any Combat Support assets that have suitable optics on board can stream live imaging directly to the C2ISTAR tablet.

We've also fixed some more bugs with Shots Fired in the War Room and added a bunch of optimisations to the code which should help improve performance some more.  Server admins please note there is also an updated plugin shipped with this version.  Grab it from the War Room!

[b]Map Indexing[/b]
There are still plenty more maps to index.  For all those people who were asking for indexing tools, they're really simple to setup and use and everything is done IN GAME! Our instructions for using the Map Indexer can be found here - [url=http://alivemod.com/wiki/index.php/Map_Indexing]http://alivemod.com/wiki/index.php/Map_Indexing[/url]

[center]Please note that as with all updates, if you have an issue loading a mission made with a previous version of ALiVE, delete and replace the modules in that mission.

[b]Disclaimer[/b]
ALiVE is now GA. However, we may need to prune the persistent database data from the War Room, eliminating data that is older than 6-12 months. The ALiVE War Room database is run on a voluntary basis at a cost to the ALiVE development team. No guarantees can be given on the mission data stored or the availability of the service. We apologise for any downtime that may impact your MP persistent missions.
