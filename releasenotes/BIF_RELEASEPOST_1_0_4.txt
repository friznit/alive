[b]Updates[/b]
The main focus of this release is to start [b]optimizing code[/b] utilising new commands from BIS (thankyou!) that should help performance. We have also been focusing on [b]addressing bugs reported[/b] by our loyal and hard working supporters posting on our forum ([url=http://alivemod.com/forum/]http://alivemod.com/forum/[/url]). We've also [b]fixed some more bugs with statistics[/b] in the War Room and added some fixes for Multispawn, OPCOM, Ambient civilians, Advanced Markers, SPOTREPS and more.  Server admins please note there is also an[b] updated ALiVE extension plugin shipped[/b] with this version. [b][url=http://alivemod.com/#ALiVEWarRoom]Grab if from the War Room Now![/url][/b]
 
[b]C2ISTAR (Command, Control, Intelligence etc.) Improvements[/b]
Those of you who watched the recent BIS livestream with 21st Rangers would have heard Friznit talking about the importance of Intel to battlefield commanders.  We've wanted to review the way Operational Intelligence is gathered and presented to Players in ALiVE in order to provide a more realistic and comprehensive set of tools.  At the tactical level, Intelligence is typically collected from sources such as EM signals, images and humans.  ALiVE already simulates HUMINT with the ability to talk to civilians and collect data on possible hostile activity.  SpyderBlack has now added a new IMINT capability to Player Commanders.  Any Combat Support assets that have suitable optics on board can stream live imaging directly to the C2ISTAR tablet.

[b]Want more maps? Map Indexing[/b]
There are still plenty more maps to index.  For all those people who were asking for indexing tools, they're really simple to setup and use and everything is done IN GAME! Our instructions for using the Map Indexer can be found here - [url=http://alivemod.com/wiki/index.php/Map_Indexing]http://alivemod.com/wiki/index.php/Map_Indexing[/url]

Note for server admins that this build[b] requires the 1.0.4 @ALiVEServer[/b] package. Any old versions (i.e. before 1.0.0) should not be used and in most cases won't work or will crash.
Please note that as with all updates, if you have an issue loading a mission made with a previous version of ALiVE, delete and replace the modules in that mission. Don't forget if using 3DEN to set appropriate default values in your modules.[/center]
