[SIZE=4]The next generation dynamic persistent campaign for ArmA3
[U]Release 0.9.4[/U][/SIZE][/B][/CENTER]

[B][U]Fixes & Enhancements[/U][/B]
This is a further incremental update to prepare the ground for 1.0 release and fix several outstanding issues and features.  Some of the more high profile issues have been fixed, such as Combat Support helicopters now turn their lights off when on task, FFV positions are no longer filled with AI, mobile mortar teams are now supported and the Military Intel Section is back in business providing valuable information on the battlefield situation.  We have added support for a number of new maps as well.  A lot of changes have been made in the background to prepare for the ALiVE Asymmetric Warfare Environment, which will simulate a complex Insurgency and Counter-Insurgency scenario.  We'll post more detail on this in due course.

Bundled with this release is Hazey's awesome update to Insurgency ALiVE based upon the ever-popular ArmA2 Insurgency, which really shows off the power and flexibility of ALiVE.  There are more details posted in his mission release thread.

Please note that as with all update, if you have an issue loading a mission made with a previous version of ALiVE, delete and replace the modules in that mission.

[B][U]War Room[/U][/B]
Most of on going War Room work is focussed on stability and robustness of the system as it sees more and more use every day.  Many thanks to all those providing feedback and troubleshooting issues with the data feeds.  You will soon see a significantly more enhanced Server Performance suite built into the War Room with some very powerful analytic tools for server admins.  Even if you're not running persistent missions, we strongly encourage you do use the ALiVE Database module to record server stats so we can build benchmarks and provide everyone and BIS with invaluable performance data.

We have also added a new 'mission' that automates high quality image capture of any addons you have loaded so they can be uploaded to the War Room.  Instructions are included in the demo folder.  If you have missing images on your War Room profile, run this up and let us know so we can upload them for you.

[B][U]Disclaimer[/U][/B]
ALiVE is still in BETA and subject to change.  We may need to clear persistent database data from the War Room before major updates but we will try to let you know well in advance if this happens.  We have done our best to ensure backward compatibility for your missions. However, in case you get a new error with an existing mission, please delete and replace the offending module in the editor and you should be good to go again.  As usual, please post any issues or feature requests on our tracker.

[B][U]Work In Progress[/U][/B]
We are hard at work on the Asymmetric Warfare Environment, popularly known as the Insurgency Module although it's technically not a single module but a whole new game mode. We have a working system already but there is a way to go before it achieves our final vision.  Our main theme at the moment is to ensure ALiVE is a intuitive and robust as we can make it for general release of 1.0  We'll be taking a long hard look at the outstanding feature request list and make some decisions about what we can realistically achieve for what will be the official gold version.  We will of course continue working on future enhancements after that!

[B][U]Thanks To[/U][/B]
Special thanks to everyone here for supporting us with donations to the War Room.  Database hosting isn't free and the overwhelming popularity of ALiVE means we are using rather more data than we originally anticipated.  If you want to contribute to keep the War Room ALiVE (see what I did there) then please find the Donate button at ALiVEmod.com!

Have fun!
