[b][u]1.0.0.1 Update - Fixes and Map Indexing[/u][/b]

[center][img=http://i.imgur.com/8PwKqxO.png][/center]

As is so often the case after achieving a major milestone, we immediately discovered a bunch of new bugs in ALiVE 1.0, so we have been busy hunting them down and squashing them.  Chief amongst them was a critical issue which was causing the game to freeze randomly up to two hours into a game.  This was a right b'staad to pin down but thanks to the perseverance of Highhead we think we have it nailed finally.

We have hinted before that we would love to allow others to help index maps but it was not possible as it was a laborious manual task and automated tools didn't exist.  Well they do now!  Tupolov created a clever little indexing tool that automates a large part of the process and makes categorising map objects far quicker and easier - all done via a simple ALiVE module placed in the editor.  Full details will be posted on our wiki.

Meanwhile Spyderblack, ArJay and the rest of the team have been working on some important performance enhancements and fixes to various modules.  Details are in the change log below.
 
[center]Please note that as with all updates, if you have an issue loading a mission made with a previous version of ALiVE, delete and replace the modules in that mission.

Also available from PlayWithSix, ArmAholic and Steam.

Note for server admins that this build requires the new @ALiVEServer package. The old one should not be used and in most cases won't work or will crash.[/center]

[b][u]Acknowledgements and Thanks[/u][/b]
Particular thanks to all those on our support forum who have worked closely with us to identify the freeze bug.  Your assistance is valuable and your dedication to ALiVE makes it all worth the effort!

[b]What's Next?[/b]
The Indexing Tool is a key step towards enabling us to open ALiVE source, which will be branded ALiVE.OS to differentiate it from our own dev branch.  We are finalising the T's & C's for the new development approach and expect to publish some further details soon.

[b][u]Disclaimer[/u][/b]
ALiVE is now GA. However, we may need to prune the persistent database data from the War Room, eliminating data that is older than 6-12 months. The ALiVE War Room database is run on a voluntary basis at a cost to the ALiVE development team. No guarantees can be given on the mission data stored or the availability of the service. We apologise for any downtime that may impact your MP persistent missions.

[b][u]ALiVE has transformed my Arma 3 experience, how can I thank you?[/u][/b]
