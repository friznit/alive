[SIZE=4]The next generation dynamic persistent campaign for ArmA3
[U]Release 0.9[/U][/SIZE][/B]

[B][U]Consolidate, Simplify, Stabilise, Enhance[/U][/B]
Our goal for this sprint was to review the current state of our code!
We fixed and stabilised where necessary and ensured that ALiVE remains aligned with our aim to provide an intuitive modular mission framework.
Feedback from users suggested ALiVE wasn’t as easy to use as we would like, so we have made some changes to how the modules are structured.
We have renamed and combined several, added guidance to the module “Show Info” tabs as well as the in game Field Manual. Full details are on the wiki.

Please note, in case you have an issue loading a mission done with a previous version of ALiVE, update the modules in that mission.
We have left the old modules hidden in the background to give you time to transition over but please update your missions as soon as possible.
The legacy modules will be removed in an upcoming release!

[B][U]War Room[/U][/B]
The team has been working hard on preparing the Operations Centre! It will enable commanders to track and manage campaigns from the War Room.
This plans to include near real time tracking of players, live intel feeds and an After Action Review feature as well as web based Command & Control tools
integrated with those we already have in game. If you’ve not done so already register with us now and start taking advantage of ALiVE mission persistence
and battlefield data feeds. Please note, that the former @Arma2NET folder for registered servers is now consolidated to @ALiVEServer!
We recommend updating your server with the shipped folder from the release package or re-downloading it from WarRoom/Server-Setup!

[B][U]Disclaimer[/U][/B]
ALiVE is still in BETA and subject to change.  We may need to clear persistent database data from the War Room before major updates but we will try to let you know well in advance if this happens.  We have done our best to ensure backward compatibility for your missions. However, in case you get a new error with an existing mission, please delete and replace the offending module in the editor and you should be good to go again.  As usual, please post any issues or feature requests on our tracker.
[B][U]Work In Progress[/U][/B]
We have an early version of the Insurgency Module working but there is quite a long way to go before it achieves our vision of delivering an intelligent asymmetric warfare simulator.  Meanwhile we’re working on a number of feature requests and enhancements across the board.  We will most likely provide a feature complete interim update prior to baselining for Release 1.0 in a couple of months time.

Its really quickly done and helps us getting ALiVE out to the community!

[B][U]Thanks To[/U][/B]
Special thanks to everyone here for supporting us with donations to the War Room.  Database hosting isn’t free and the overwhelming popularity of ALiVE means we are using rather more data than we originally anticipated.

Have fun!
