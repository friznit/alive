[size=4]The next generation dynamic persistent mission addon for ArmA3
Release 1.0[/size][/b][/center]
[center] [/center]
[b][u]After more than 3 years of development we are proud to release version 1.0 of ALiVE![/u][/b]

[center][img=http://i.imgur.com/8PwKqxO.png][/center]
It's a huge moment for the ALiVE team to announce the 1.0 release.  ALiVE represents thousands of hours of volunteer time from a small team working every evening, weekend and holiday available.  Our vision for ALiVE was to create a dynamic, persistent and credibly realistic battlefield environment that brought ArmA3 missions to life.  Our aim was to do deliver this with an intuitive, modular mission framework that required minimal technical expertise for mission makers yet provided everything that players needed to set up and run military operations in almost any scenario, including command, combat support, service support and logistics.  Critically, we wanted AI Commanders that automatically planned and directed missions for all AI forces across the Area of Operations, identifying strategic objectives and reacting to changes in the tactical situation.  To make all this happen with minimal impact on performance, we needed a Virtual AI Profile system in order to support thousands of units continuing to operate across the map when players were not present.  We are delighted that we have been able to deliver on all our objectives and more!
 
[b][u]Rel 1.0 Update[/u][/b]

This release includes a number of fixes since our feature complete Release Candidate in November.  Key amongst them is Headless Client integration for Combat Support, fixes to the plugin to avoid persistence failing, fixes to our client connection code, support for custom compositions, updates to player resupply and some other minor fixes - see the full change log below!

There is a long list of maps that people would like to see indexed for ALiVE and unfortunately we simply haven't had the time to include them all in this release.  However, we will very soon be in a position to enable community members to index maps so hopefully we can get more cracked then.  More details to follow soon!

To celebrate our release we are including a new Johari Bonus Track called [i]Everest[/i]. The track is particularly fitting as it's taken our team of dedicated people to reach the summit of ALiVE 1.0! We hope you enjoy it.  It features in 2 of the 4 intro missions we have on the Arma 3 main menu, alongside the ALiVE exclusive Arma 3 cover [i]This is War[/i] by Johari (note that you easily disable this by removing intro.pbo if it is not your thing).
 
[center]Please note that as with all updates, if you have an issue loading a mission made with a previous version of ALiVE, delete and replace the modules in that mission.

Note for server admins that this build absolutely requires the new @ALiVEServer package. The old one should not be used and in most cases won't work (or will crash).[/center]

[b][u]Acknowledgements and Thanks[/u][/b]

We wanted to take this chance to thank the following key people for their support and recognise the efforts of those that have dedicated so much time to this project:
[LIST]
[*][b]Wolffy.au[/b] - One of the original developers of MSO and helped kick off the MSO Next Gen vission that later became ALiVE[/*]
[*][b]Tupolov[/b] - A key contributor to MSO and one of the driving forces behind development of ALiVE, in particular the cloud-based persistence system, sitreps/spotreps/stats, IED system, ALiVE War Room and more.[/*]
[*][b]Highhead[/b] - Another former MSO developer and driving force behind ALiVE, building the AI Command & Control including the Operational Commander, Insurgency, CQB and so much more. He also implemented support for headless client and player logistics support.[/*]
[*][b]ARJay[/b] - ALiVE would not scale without the immense Virtual AI system created by ARJay. This system has been interwoven into many aspects of ALiVE and ARJay has contributed across pretty much all of the ALIVE codebase as well as being a lead developer of the ALiVE War Room, C2ISTAR and lots more.[/*]
[*][b]Friznit[/b] - We could not get anything done without a key focus on how ALiVE is used, implemented and simulates modern warfare. Friznit brought focus and organisation to the team along with his military experience, unique brand of PR and of course documentation![/*]
[*][b]Jman[/b] - Our release master and general all round good bean who has contributed to the original persistence system and many admin and player helper systems.[/*]
[*][b]Gunny[/b] - Shepherded much of the ported combat support system (thank you Neo!) into ALiVE and assisted with a number of other systems.[/*]
[*][b]Secure[/b] - In our desire to remove dependence on .NET and Windows, Secure completely rewrote the plugin/extension system to make it multi-platform and faster[/*]
[*][b]Hazey[/b] - Helped with testing and support as well as custom compositions and the original insurgency mission for ALiVE[/*]
[*][b]SpyderBlack[/b] - Has been a huge help in supporting the community with his expertise as a mission maker and has written add-ons to ALiVE that have since been incorporated.[/*]

[b]What's Next?[/b]
After the release of 1.0, ALiVE development will be making a strategic change in direction.  We kept the source code private during development in order to maintain control and facilitate support and error fixing.  It is time to change that!  With the widespread adoption of ALiVE, we believe that the mod will benefit from the combined resources of the community to allow it to continue to develop and flourish. There is still so much more that could be done with ALiVE both as a mod and a platform and we hope this will give the community the opportunity to take it to the next level. We will announce the details and support for this approach in the near future!

[b][u]Disclaimer[/u][/b]
ALiVE is now GA. However, we may need to prune the persistent database data from the War Room, eliminating data that is older than 6-12 months. The ALiVE War Room database is run on a voluntary basis at a cost to the ALiVE development team. No guarantees can be given on the mission data stored or the availability of the service. We apologise for any downtime that may impact your MP persistent missions.
