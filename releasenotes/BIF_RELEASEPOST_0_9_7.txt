[SIZE=4]The next generation dynamic persistent mission addon for ArmA3
Release 0.9.7[/SIZE][/B][/CENTER]

[B][U]Asymmetric Warfare Environment[/U][/B]
The headline for this release is the addition of a new type of Military AI Commander.  Asymmetric Commanders have different objectives, tactics and techniques to a regular combatant.  His goal is to disrupt the enemy, destabilise the security situation and generally create havoc without becoming decisively engaged with security forces.  Insurgency forces will employ tactics such as sabotage, hit and run attacks, roadblocks and IEDs.  They will attempt to blend in with the civilian population in order to move weapons, explosives and suicide bombers to strategic locations whilst establishing secret weapons caches, IED factories and recruitment centres to spread the insurgency amongst the disillusioned civilian population.  Security Forces will need to conduct rigorous patrolling and develop strong intelligence through searching and monitoring of civilian activity in order to reduce the insurgent threat.

A full description of ALiVE Asymmetric Warfare including a setup guide and hints for Security Forces is available on the [url=http://alivemod.com/wiki/index.php/Insurgency]ALiVE Wiki Here[/url]

[CENTER]Please note that as with all updates, if you have an issue loading a mission made with a previous version of ALiVE, delete and replace the modules in that mission.

[B][U]War Room[/U][/B]
The Server Performance suite built into the War Room has had a makeover with a lot of detail added to explain what each metric means.  This is a very powerful analytical tool for server admins and we strongly encourage people to try it, even if only standalone without any other aspects of ALiVE.  This will help us to record server stats so we can build a benchmark and provide everyone and BIS with invaluable performance data.

[B][U]Want to join our team?[/U][/B]
We are still recruiting people that are interested in being part of a close knit dev team. We welcome anyone who fancies a go at SQF scripting, Javascript/PHP development (for War Room) and C++/C# development for our ALiVE extension. ALiVE is an opportunity to build your experience of any of these technologies in a fun mod development environment.

[B][U]Disclaimer[/U][/B]
ALiVE is still in BETA and subject to change.  We may need to clear persistent database data from the War Room before major updates but we will try to let you know well in advance if this happens.  We have done our best to ensure backward compatibility for your missions. However, in case you get a new error with an existing mission, please delete and replace the offending module in the editor and you should be good to go again.  As usual, please post any issues or feature requests on our tracker.

[B][U]Work In Progress[/U][/B]
We're now on the final few sprints in the run up to the official 1.0 release.  The continuing focus is to ensure ALiVE is a intuitive and robust as we can make it.  There are a lot of features we would like to enhance but it's abundantly clear we won't achieve all of them in the time frame we've set ourselves.  A fair amount will depend on how this release goes and how much effort will be required to stabilise Asymmetric before moving on to other features.
