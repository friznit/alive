[b]Bug Fixes [/b]
The third release since GA! Indeed, since our GA we've had some great feedback on our forum ([url=http://alivemod.com/forum/]http://alivemod.com/forum/[/url]) and also some bug reports. This is our 3rd update in almost as many weeks and features some important fixes. We added the first community created map index in Australia - by Fadi! SpyderBlack has been busy improving our C2ISTAR tablet performance for intel and taskings. We've squashed a major issue with our Indexing Tool that slipped through QA. We've also fixed some more issues with Combat Support and addressed some community reported bugs relating to multispawn, IEDs and much more.

[b]Are you using ACE? Would you like to use our mission persistence and stats with War Room?[/b]
Good news! We've now fixed the issues related to registering kills and weapon usage with ACE! Many thanks to support of the ACE team and specifically Glowbal! [url=http://alivemod.com/#ALiVEWarRoom]Join the War Room Now![/url]

[b]Map Indexing[/b]
Yes, we've added Australia - but there are so many more maps to do! We are relying on you guys to get to grips with out indexing tool... Its really simple to setup and use and everything is done IN GAME! Our instructions for using the Map Indexer have been UPDATED and can be found here - [url=http://alivemod.com/wiki/index.php/Map_Indexing]http://alivemod.com/wiki/index.php/Map_Indexing[/url]

[b]Remember playing MSO on Takistan?[/b]
With the latest release of the amazing Community Upgrade Project including both BAF and US Army forces, we have recreated one of MSO's most popular missions! A 32 COOP dynamic persistent mission in Takistan taking on Militias and insurgents! The mission requires the full set of CUP [url=http://cup-arma3.org/download]downloads[/url] (Terrains, Weapons, Units, Vehicles). You can download the sample mission (unbinarized) here - [url=http://alivemod.com/downloads/CO32_A3CUPALIVE_BAF_USA_vs_TAK_INS.Takistan.zip]CO32_A3CUPALIVE_BAF_USA_vs_TAK_INS.Takistan.zip[/url]

[center]Please note that as with all updates, if you have an issue loading a mission made with a previous version of ALiVE, delete and replace the modules in that mission.

[b]Changelog[/b]
[spoiler]
[VARIOUS] Fixed placement modules Readiness parameter not working properly when option other than 100% was selected.
[MIL C2ISTAR] Set input default to Array as _logic needs to be a hash
[MIL CQB] Disabled client FPS reporting as obsolete since JIP-AI-spawn option was disabled
[MIL_C2ISTAR] Fix error due to incorrect usage of BIS_fnc_param
[X_LIB] Fixed fnc_inArea to handle location objects
[SUP MULTISPAWN] Fixed crew was not deleted from a synced helicopter. Fixed: If a synced helicopter was not of the same faction as the player (f.e. if default vehicle was chosen) then insertion worked only once, making players hang in waiting screen. Fixed: If an ALiVE_SUP_MULTISPAWN_INSERTION_%FACTION% marker was used and a vehicle was synced a script error was thrown. Added: "Respawn With Gear" option on the module (backward compatible)
[INDEXES] Added full index of Australia (thanks Fadi)

[SUP_COMMAND] Reverting to group list now works when a waypoint is selected. Performance improvements

[SYS_INDEXER] Fix indexing for non dev environments.
[MIL CQB | MIL C2ISTAR] Moved T.R.A.C.E. Intel system from CQB to C2ISTAR. Fixed: TRACE was marking grids green for players of other sides. Fixed: Sometimes grids were not showing as cleared for JIP players. Fixed: Re-occupied grids were not always uncleared, but stayed green. Improved: every side now gets their own cleared sectors displayed. Improved: Storing cleared sectors-data (preparation for DB persistency).
[SUP_COMBATSUPPORT] Fixed buttons turning back when focused
[SUP_COMBATSUPPORT] Added code field to artillery module
[SYS_STATISTICS] Fixed issue where number of shots fired per weapon were not reported

[VARIOUS] Fixed remaining UI errors ("cannot load control")
[MIL CQB] Changed "error" to "none" to avoid sys data false-positives
[MIL C2ISTAR] Fixed ALiVE_taskhandler and ALiVE_taskhandlerClient haven't been created correctly and script error was thrown if task events were received from the server before task system was fully initialized locally on the JIP client
[SYS PROFILE] Fixed: If a persistent mission was loaded from DB then newly created virtual groups where not given unique IDs (overwriting existing groups in some cases)
[VARIOUS] Removed usage of BIS_fnc_inTrigger and switched to ALiVE_fnc_inArea
[X LIB] Updated ALiVE_fnc_inArea to accept also position-array as input

[b]Acknowledgements and Thanks[/b]
Particular thanks to all those on our support forum who have worked closely with us to identify bugs, provide logs and generally help us improve ALiVE. Your assistance is valuable and your dedication to ALiVE makes it all worth the effort!

[b]What's Next?[/b]
The Indexing Tool is a key step towards enabling us to open ALiVE source, which will be branded ALiVE.OS to differentiate it from our own dev branch. We are finalising the T's & C's for the new development approach and expect to publish some further details soon.

[b]Disclaimer[/b]
ALiVE is now GA. However, we may need to prune the persistent database data from the War Room, eliminating data that is older than 6-12 months. The ALiVE War Room database is run on a voluntary basis at a cost to the ALiVE development team. No guarantees can be given on the mission data stored or the availability of the service. We apologise for any downtime that may impact your MP persistent missions.

[b]ALiVE has transformed my Arma 3 experience, how can I thank you?[/b]
Please consider making a contribution to our server costs if you enjoy ALiVE! It costs us $65 per month to run our War Room website and the ALiVE Database servers and every little helps. Donate here [url=http://www.alivemod.com/#Donate]http://www.alivemod.com/#Donate[/url]

Special thanks to everyone here for supporting us with donations to the ALiVE mod development effort.

Have fun!
