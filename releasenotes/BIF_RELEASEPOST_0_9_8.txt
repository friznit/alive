[SIZE=4]The next generation dynamic persistent mission addon for ArmA3
Release 0.9.8[/SIZE][/B][/CENTER]

[B][U]Optimisation[/U][/B]
The main focus of this release is performance and loading optimisation.  We have been polishing up some of the older modules and exercising the new commands introduced by ArmA3 1.44 and the latest CBA.  Also in this release is the second iteration of Asymmetric Warfare Environment, which includes a lot of bug fixes and tweaks - many thanks to everyone for providing feedback and please keep it coming!  There's been a bit of a hiatus with map indexing because we've been working on a new process that should hopefully simplify and reduce the effort required.  Our newest team member, Cry3rn, has been hard at work reviewing the scripts and while there is no standalone tool for indexing, if all goes well with the current work it is something we hope to be able to provide in the future.

[CENTER]Please note that as with all updates, if you have an issue loading a mission made with a previous version of ALiVE, delete and replace the modules in that mission.

[B][U]Want to join our team?[/U][/B]
We are still recruiting people that are interested in being part of a close knit dev team. We welcome anyone who fancies a go at SQF scripting, Javascript/PHP development (for War Room) and C++/C# development for our ALiVE extension. ALiVE is an opportunity to build your experience of any of these technologies in a fun mod development environment.

[B][U]Disclaimer[/U][/B]
ALiVE is still in BETA and subject to change.  We may need to clear persistent database data from the War Room before major updates but we will try to let you know well in advance if this happens.  We have done our best to ensure backward compatibility for your missions. However, in case you get a new error with an existing mission, please delete and replace the offending module in the editor and you should be good to go again.  As usual, please post any issues or feature requests on our tracker.

[B][U]Work In Progress[/U][/B]
We're now on the final few sprints in the run up to the official 1.0 release.  The continuing focus is to ensure ALiVE is a intuitive and robust as we can make it.  There are a lot of features we would like to enhance but it's abundantly clear we won't achieve all of them in the time frame we've set ourselves.  We still have a lot to do and many more ideas besides, so the 1.0 release will certainly not be the last.

[B][U]ALiVE has transformed my Arma 3 experience, how can I thank you?[/U][/B]
