[B][U]Logistics[/U][/B]
Logistics is a critical feature of warfare and no battlefield would be complete without it.  We have built a fully functioning battlefield logistics system that reflects the continual demand for supplies and battle casualty replacements required to maintain operational effectiveness of front line fighting forces.  Our credibly realistic, fully autonomous [b]Military Logistics[/b] system assesses the tactical situation and delivers BCRs and vehicles to the front line Operational Commanders (OPCOM) on demand.  Of course these supply routes are vulnerable to interdiction, allowing players to disrupt enemy supply lines by ambushing logistics convoys, choking off the vital flow of supplies and having an actual, meaningful impact on the enemy’s fighting power.

Recognising that players need logistics too, we have added a simple “lift & shift” system that allows players to move objects and ammo crates in cargo and tow vehicles.  When using the Database module, you can now benefit from full persistence of every object the player interacts with.  [b]ALiVE Player Logistics[/b] is On by default when running ALiVE but can easily be enabled or disabled with a module in the editor or in game from the ALiVE menu.  This is useful if you prefer to use one of the other logistics systems made by the community.  Note that Persistence should work with them too but there may be some conflicts - please provide us with feedback!  Additionally, there is an [b]ALiVE Player Resupply[/b] tablet to request new vehicles, equipment and AI units from the same logistics force pool as OPCOM.

We didn’t feel that was quite enough for an incremental update (!) so we have also developed a [b]Custom Objectives Module[/b].  This neat module can be placed anywhere on the map to quickly and easily create pre-populated military objectives, complete with one of several custom compositions.  It can be used standalone or integrated into the operational planning layer by syncing to OPCOM.

The Logistics Update is a major milestone for us and it has been a massive effort turning our original concepts into reality.  Here are some videos demonstrating Logistics and Custom Objectives in action:

[B][U]War Room[/U][/B]
We have made some major performance improvements to our web platform as it continues to improve and grow well beyond our initial expectations! We have over 5000 players registered from 550 groups and over a million events captured. We will be adding new functionality to War Room over the coming months.  Register with us now and start taking advantage of ALiVE mission persistence and battlefield data feeds.

[B][U]Disclaimer[/U][/B]
ALiVE is still in ALPHA and subject to change.  We may need to clear database data before major updates but we will let you know well in advance if this happens.  We have done our best to ensure backward compatibility for your missions. However, in case you get a new error with an existing mission, please delete and replace the offending module in the editor and you should be good to go again.  As usual, please post any issues or feature requests on our tracker.

NOTE:  mil_convoys is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  We'll leave it in for the moment so it doesn't break missions but it will be gone in the future.  Fair warning!

[B][U]Work In Progress[/U][/B]
Our focus is now shifting to enhancing OPCOM and improving Command & Control.  We are reworking Combat Support from scratch to be more stable, flexible and intuitive.  This will also enable users to add init lines on CS units, which is a regular request.  We are also exploring more in depth game integration with War Room to provide two-way data for reporting, tasks and mission logs.  Finally, we are starting work on the design of a full Insurgency Module.

[B][U]Welcome To[/U][/B]
We are always on the look out for talented individuals who are committed to contributing quality addons to the community.  Our associate dev team members have already added a huge amount of value to ALiVE and we are working closely with other leading mod teams to maximise compatibility.  In particular, we would like to welcome Cameroon and Haze onto the team.  Cameroon is working on improvements to Combat Support and Logistics.  Haze is hard at work building custom compositions for the Objectives Module.

[B][U]Thanks To[/U][/B]
Special thanks to everyone here for supporting us with donations to the War Room.  Database hosting isn’t free and the overwhelming popularity of ALiVE means we are using rather more data than we originally anticipated.  If you want to contribute to keep the War Room ALiVE (see what I did there) then please find the Donate button at ALiVEmod.com!

Have fun!
