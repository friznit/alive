We kept ALiVE source code private during development for source control and to facilitiate support and error fixing.  Having achieved the 1.0 milestone after 3 years of development, we are now delighted to declare the code repo open.  We believe that the mod will benefit from the combined resources of the community to allow it to continue to develop and flourish. There is still so much more that could be done with ALiVE both as a mod and a platform and we hope this will give the community the opportunity to take it to the next level.
