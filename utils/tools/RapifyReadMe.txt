1.72

fixed erroneous include filename message when error detected

allowed -k option to NOT pause on error

Rapify will binarise files into either flashpoint or elite/arma format.

The default is ARMA rapification and can be overridden on the command line to produce ofp format.

ANY file irrespective of it's extension, can be binarised. Thus *.rvmat, *.bikb *.ext *.fsm, *.cpp, *.sqm




Useage:

Rapify [options...] whatever [wherever]

===Output rules===

UNCONDITIONAL: *.cpp to *.bin

*else to *else.bin (unless a [wherever] is declared in which case

 mission.sqm to mission.sqm (eg)


Options are case insensitive

-S silent (default)
-N Noisy. show processing
-L Lintcheck only (no save file)
-A default Arma force arma compile, otherwise detect _ARMA_
-O ofp compile
-R relaxed lintcheck (default)
-E exacting lint check (external file checking)
-K do not pause on error

if [wherever] is not specified,. the output is the .bin extension to the original name

===External File checking =====

requires that the config.cpp is in the 'correct' location on the P: drive.

this because all internal references in a config.cpp are HARD WIRED to the p drive.
Ridiculous as this is, even tho you might have a p3d inside the config (INSIDE THE PBO) it is referenced by that config as \somehwere\on\virtual\prefix\myGreatAddon

There is NO RELATIVE ADDRESSING. Why not beggars the imagination.


====Note for Elite and Armed Insult 1&2 ====

As dreadful as Armed Insult is, and *because* most ofp developers have abandoned BIS completely, and because there remains now only an ArmA, multiplayer-mostly community,
the default rapify is for Armed Insult (rather than ofp) 


However:

to rapify into arma (or elite) the macro

#define _ARMA_

should be declared as first statement of the text body. You should do this as a matter of professional pride in your work, since there is NO
distinguishable difference between ofp and arma rap text.

With interest returning in the older, better, game, I may reverse the default at some future date.

For this reason, it is reccomended you exlpicitly state the -O or -A option.




For xbox files that require authentication keys use

#define _XBOX_ with Signature

The 20 key sig will be autogenerated by this application.
===========================================

######include Notes####

OFP uses relative addressing (relative to the pbo)

BIS can't quite get their act together with ARMA

for ADDONS #includes are HARD PATH P:\references

for MISSIONS

it depends if it's wednesday.


The dll engine does it's best to heuristically decide which is what.
